 There are so many functions in this website that I have implemented. Here are some features:

 • Search Option for each Category. User can search by Categories.

 • Single page application. Page will never reload if he/she change the route.

 • User can donate by clicking on the "donate" button from the card.

 • React Toast is available on the Card.

 • User can see details of the card if the click on view details. 

 • If a user donate more than 4, then show more and show less button will be available on that route. 

 • User can delete all the donations from the card by clicking delete button.
 
 • The most exciting feature is that an user cann see statistics on pie chart if they don't donate, still it will show and if they donate, it will show.
